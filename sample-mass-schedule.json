            "content": "The Season of Septuagesima is a preparation for the great penitential season of Lent. It is called <em>Septuagesima<\/em>, meaning <em>seventieth day<\/em>, because some of the clergy and faithful in the earliest ages of the Church began to fast seventy days before Easter. The Sundays following are called Sexagesima, Quinquagesima, and Quadragesima (which is the first Sunday of Lent), because some Christians commenced fasting sixty or fifty days before Easter, until forty (quadragesima) became uniform. From Septuagesima until Easter the Church omits in her service all joyful canticles, Alleluias, and the <em>Gloria in excelsis<\/em>. This is gradually to prepare the minds of the faithful for the serious time of penance and sorrow on the horizon; to remind the sinner of the grievousness of his errors, and to exhort him to penance. The liturgical color of the season is violet, the color of penance. To arouse in us sorrow for our sins, and show the need of repentance, the holy liturgy in the name of all mankind cries with David: The groans of death surrounded me, the sorrows of hell encompassed me: and in my affliction I called upon the Lord, and he heard my voice from his holy temple (<em>Goffine<\/em>).",

            "content": "The holy Season of Lent, according to the ancient tradition of the Church, is a penitential season of forty days. This penitential time has three main purposes: to curb the concupiscence of the flesh, to facilitate the elevation of our souls toward divine realities, and to make satisfaction for our sins. Our Lord gave us the example during His life here on earth: pray and do penance! The faithful who have the spirit of the Faith will wholeheartedly enter into the practice of this holy season by means of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. In their penitential practice, besides fasting and abstinence, souls do well to take on additional penances, which might be abstinence from certain foods and beverages, from television, from electronic devices, or other similar sacrifices. Fervent souls will make an effort to pray more, to assist more frequently at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, to recite the Rosary, and not to miss evening prayers with the family. They will detach themselves from everything superfluous in order to draw near to God, the source of the interior life. Sanctity is attained by means of the Cross; if we truly seek perfection then we must follow the Way of the Cross (<em>Archbishop Lefebvre<\/em>).",

The holy liturgy, in union with Our Lady of Sorrows, is imbued with sorrowful meditation on the holy Passion of Our Lord and the Church puts on the widow\u2019s garments. One of the most striking changes in the Passiontide is that the crosses and statues are draped, as an outward sign of the Church\u2019s inward sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe veiling of the Cross is a relic from an ancient practice. When crosses, without the corpus, shone glorious with gold and precious stones (the <em>crux gemmata<\/em>), there was deep meaning in the practice of veiling their brilliance during the days when the Bridegroom was taken away. In the spiritual life, we contemplate the various scenes of the bitter passion, we are immersed into all the feelings and thoughts of our suffering Savior, and we adore the virtues displayed by the Lord at every step. \"<em>How shall I imitate Him\u2026 what can I learn from Him?<\/em>\" are our most important questions. Suffering is the great motive for amendment: \"<em>He died on the Cross for me, and I have offended Him so deeply<\/em>.\" Indeed, on Good Friday, we lift up our voices, crying: <em>Ave Crux, spes unica! Hail O Cross, our only hope!<\/em> (<em>Parsch<\/em>)",

After the voluntary penances of Lent, and amidst all the involuntary sufferings of daily life, the Resurrection of Our Lord reminds us not only of the immense love He bears for us, but of our final destiny. The liturgy is the teacher of life. All throughout Lent, we have followed the life of Our Lord leading to his Passion, Death, and Resurrection. Holy Mother Church puts before us the beautiful Collects and readings during this season to help us enter into union with Christ more intimately. Our brief time here in the vale of tears is but a preparation for eternity. The joy and hope of Easter remind us like nothing else can of Our Lord's desire that we remain united to him here on earth and in heaven. Let us take this responsibility seriously, properly celebrating this season which ends with the Octave of Pentecost, and looking forward to the day when all sorrows shall end! Indeed, He is risen!",

The solemnity of Pentecost and its octave are over, and the progress of the liturgical year introduces us into a new period, which is altogether different from those we have hitherto spent. In this season the sacred liturgy puts before us an almost unbroken succession of varied episodes, of which some are brilliant with glory, and others exquisite in loveliness, but each one of them bringing its special tribute towards either the development of the dogmas of faith, or the furtherance of the Christian life. Such are the great feasts of Corpus Christi, the Sacred Heart, the Most Precious Blood, Our Lady\u2019s Assumption, etc. As the season draws nigh to Advent, it will thus be filled up; it will disappear; a new one will take its place, bringing before us the same divine facts, and pouring forth the same graces on Christ\u2019s Mystical Body (<em>Gu\u00e9ranger<\/em>).",

Receiving His human nature from the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, His Mother, whose Virginity He preserves, He thereby proves that He has lost nothing of His Divinity.\r\nThe Church prepares during this holy season to welcome the Savior, Jesus, true God and true man. Let us not forget that Advent is a time of penance in which we should redouble our efforts, sacrifices, and prayers. Let us be careful not to celebrate Christmas in advance, or to make this time of preparation a time of celebration and frivolity as do the pagans.

The Epiphany is indeed great Feast, and the joy caused us by the Birth of our Jesus is renewed on it, for, as though it were a second Christmas Day, it shows us our Incarnate God in a new light. At Christmas, it was a few Shepherds that were invited by the Angels to go and recognize the Word made flesh; but now, at the Epiphany, the voice of God himself calls the whole world to adore Jesus, and to hear him. The Kings of the East come to the Babe in his crib, bearing with them the prayers and adorations of the whole human race. Mary, the Throne of the divine Wisdom, welcomes all the members of this court with her gracious smile of Mother and Queen; she offers her Son to man, for his adoration, and to God, that he may be well pleased. God manifests himself to men, because he is great: but he manifests himself by Mary, because he is full of mercy (<em>Gu\u00e9ranger<\/em>).",
